Hi, my name is Levan Salamashvili.
I’m 23 years old, and I’m a junior front-end developer from Georgia.

Before I started learning programming, I had a completely different dream — I wanted to be a professional basketball player.
Yeah, really. I spent a lot of time practicing; I really wanted to be as good as Stephen Curry.
But let’s just say I wasn’t exactly hitting those three-pointers like him.

Still, basketball taught me a lot about discipline, consistency, and how to handle challenges — and those lessons really helped me later when I started coding.

After that, I decided to try something I had been curious about for a long time — programming.
At first, I started learning completely on my own — watching tutorials, reading articles, and trying to understand how websites actually work.
The more I learned, the more I loved it.

I realized that programming gave me the same excitement as sports — solving problems, improving every day, and creating something from scratch.

Later, I joined a web development course at Re:Educate, where I built real projects and gained experience with modern technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and more.
It was an amazing experience because I learned not only how to code but also how to work in a team — basically, how to think like a real developer.

What I really love about web development is that it mixes logic and creativity.
You use logic to make things work, but creativity to make them look and feel right.
Turning an idea into a fully working website feels so rewarding, and I love the fact that there’s always something new to learn.

Right now, I’m focused on becoming a strong front-end developer and improving my JavaScript and React skills.
In the future, I’d like to build products that not only look great but also make people’s lives easier.

Thank you so much for watching my video!
I’m super happy to be part of RS School, and I can’t wait to learn, grow, and maybe one day… write code as accurately as Steph Curry shoots threes.

Goodbye!
